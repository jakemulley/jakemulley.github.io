ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Jake Mulley. I'm a hands-on technical lead, software engineer, and technical architect.

I have over 11 years experience working within the public and private sectors, as well as with agencies, startups and charities.

I'm currently a **Principal Technical Architect** at the UK government's [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice).

Day to day, I regularly work on:

- modernising legacy products, services, and infrastructure
- defining and building technical architecture, specialising in cloud-native technology and serverless
- building accessible, progessively-enhanced services
- designing data-driven and domain-driven services
- collaborating across stakeholders at all levels to gain buy-in and define technical strategies

To do this, I tend to utilise whatever is best for the job at hand, though I often use:

| Purpose              | Thing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

- AWS SSO for authentication into AWS accounts
- centralised security services and monitoring
- [and more](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account)...
