I'm currently a **Principal Cloud Engineer** at [PhysicsX](https://www.physicsx.ai), a [series B startup](https://www.physicsx.ai/newsroom/physicsx-raises-135m-series-b-to-usher-in-a-new-era-of-ai-native-engineering-and-manufacturing) that is accelerating industrial innovation with AI.

Before joining PhysicsX in February 2024, I spent 12 years as a platform engineer and technical architect in UK government, and as a full-stack engineer at software-as-a-service companies, digital agencies, and more.
