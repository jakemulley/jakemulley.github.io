ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Jake Mulley. I'm a hands-on technical leader, software engineer, and technical architect, all rolled into one.

I have 10 years experience working within the public and private sectors, as well as with agencies, startups and charities.

I'm currently **Lead Technical Architect** at the UK government's [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice).

Day to day, I regularly work on:

- Modernising legacy products, services, and infrastructure
- Defining and building technical architecture, specialising in serverless
- Building accessible services with progressive enhancement
- Designing data-driven and domain-driven services
- Collaborating across stakeholders to get buy-in and define technical strategies

To do this, I tend to utilise whatever is best for the job at hand, though I often use:

<span class="text-sm">_Aug 2020 &ndash; Mar 2021_</span>

Prior to becoming Head of Hosting & Digital Operations, I was Technical Architect for the [Modernisation Platform](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#modernisation-platform).

The Modernisation Platform vision is:

>a single platform which allows the Ministry of Justice to modernise services, and run them in a unified, scalable way

I led a multi-disciplinary team and built a platform that:

- automated environment provisioning
- automated security baselines within AWS
- enforced CI/CD for infrastructure configuration and deployment
- started to automate networking configuration to centralise networking management for legacy services

I also started to [centralise and maintain best practises within the Ministry of Justice's AWS estate](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account), including introducing:

- AWS SSO for authentication into AWS accounts
- centralised security services and monitoring
- [and more](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account)...
